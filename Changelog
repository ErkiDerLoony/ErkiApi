0.0.4
– Screw the old completely self-written plot api in favour of a more powerful implementation
  that is based on JFreeChart.
– Rework configuration api. Now arbitrary (serializable) Java objects can be stored either
  directly as serialized Java objects or xml encoded via the XStream library.
– Identify localized strings via enum constants and not via strings any more.

0.0.3
– Command line parser can now handle list of files at the end.
– The log level used is now the one from java logging.
– Added a simple configuration api that stores program settings. It is not yet completely
  usable but a simple ini-style format is already working.
– Added a box axis for the plot.
– Allow the same command line switch to appear more than once and parse the multiple
  occurrences into a list.
– The log can now print information without a prefix.

0.0.2
– Style provider support for the plot api that bundles the configuration of the look and
  feel of the plot in one (or few) class(es).
– New coordinate axes that are no longer static but are always displayed at the border of
  the plot.
– Zoom and move functionality for the plot.
– The log automagically determines the source of the log message (kind of a hack) so the
  source need not be supplied at each call of a log method.
– Improved command line parser.
– Add a simple, easy to use sound player to the utilities.
– Improved localizor. The translations can now also be split into several files.

0.0.1
– Extended Java Swing to create a look and feel that roughly reminds of the LCARS layout
  from the various Star Trek series.
– Various utilities, e.g. Log, CommandLineParser, Localizor.
